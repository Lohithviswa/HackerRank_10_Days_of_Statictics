After 1 red marble is drawn, there will be 2 red marbles and 4 blue marbles in the bag. 
So, in the bag's current state, there is a 2/6 probability of drawing a red marble and a 4/6 probability of drawing a blue marble. 
Because our goal is to find the probability of drawing a blue marble, our answer is 4/6 (which reduces to 2/3).
